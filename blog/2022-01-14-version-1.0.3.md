### Cummulative Update to v1.0.3

With the adaption of the sandbox, the playground did not support 👎 showing errors for parsing error and ambuity 🤷‍♂️ in displaying lexical errors.

Infant Lang Core Team 🐱‍💻 got a feature request to improve it. With the release of Interpreter v1.0.3, the playground supports displaying parsing errors with less ambiguity.

I hope you like playing with Infant 👶 Lang.
