:::info

The **Arithmetic** module is still in beta 👶

:::

- Infant lang supports basic arithmetic of integers.
- Throws error if a division returns a decimal 💀
- Throws error if pointer or memory becomes negative 💀

:::note

**Division by zero** is still not possible 😒

Division by zero is technically not possible 😏

:::

Addition ➕, subtraction ➖, multiplication ✖ and division ➗ of two numbers, with memory or with the pointer and store it in the memory 📦

<Tabs
    defaultValue="pointers"
    values={[
        {label: 'With Pointers', value: 'pointers'},
        {label: 'With Memory', value: 'memory'},
        {label: 'With a Number', value: 'number'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="pointers">

    memory = pointer - pointer

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="memory">

    memory = memory * memory

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="number">

    memory = pointer * 13

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::danger

After an arithmetic operation, the `memory` must be assigned to the result of the operation. Otherwise, the program will stop executing 💀

This will be fixed in the next version of Infant Lang.
