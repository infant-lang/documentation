# Pointer

The most important concept in Infant Lang is the **pointer** ðŸ‘†

The pointer is a number that points to the position of the arrow in the number line ðŸ“Š

The pointer is initialized to point the box 0. It can point only to whole numbers.

It can move `left` or `right` but cannot go beyond the limits of the `whole number line`

## tldr;

- The Pointer is initialized to point the 0 box ðŸ“¦
- The Pointer can hold only whole numbers ðŸ“Š
- The pointer can be moved with the `move` ðŸš— keyword.
- The pointer can be moved left or right with the `left` ðŸ‘ˆ and `right` ðŸ‘‰ keywords.

## The `move` keyword

The pointer can be moved left or right with the `left` and `right` keywords. Let's see how it works:

Have a look at the following snippet:
```infant
move pointer right 
```

## What does this code do?
The `move pointer right` moves the pointer right 1 box ðŸ“¦. Which in reality will increase the pointer by 1 ðŸ‘ˆ. We can also move the pointer right with the `left` keyword.

Moving Pointer value to a negative number will cause the pointer to go beyond the limits of the **whole number line** ðŸ“Š. It will throw an error and stops the execution of the script.

## Move pointer for more than one box
The pointer can be moved for more than one box with the `movement number` associated with the `move` keyword. The `movement number` defaults to `1`. Let's see how it works:

```infant
# This line will move the pointer to the right by one box
move pointer right

# This line will move the pointer to the right by 12 boxes
move pointer right 12
```

We can also move pointer conditionally with the `if` keyword or move insanely fast with the `for` keyword which will be explained in the upcoming sections.
