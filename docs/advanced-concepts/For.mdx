The `for` statement lets you repeat a statement a specified number of times. 

## Key Concepts
- Do repetitive stuff with the for 🏃‍♂️💨
- No variable initialization 😲
- Enter a positive integer 🔢 or pass the pointer 👆 or memory 📦
- Heard of single line for? Bet you haven’t 😏

## Repetitive stuff is easy with the `for`

Infant Lang has one of the easiest `for` loop constructions. 
Simply pass a number 🔢 to do a repetitive task for the specified number of times.

You can do crazy stuff with the `for` loop. For example, move a pointer insanely fast, print a lot of stuff, and check the condition multiple times until it is fulfilled.

You can also pass the `if` statement, which gets executed if the condition is fulfilled.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="pointers"
    values={[
        {label: 'Move Pointers', value: 'pointers'},
        {label: 'Check a condition', value: 'if'},
        {label: 'Print Stuff', value: 'print'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="pointers">

    # Moves the pointer right one by one upto the number in the memory 📦
    for memory move pointer right

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="if">

    for pointer if memory == pointer memory = pointer + 1

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="print">

    for 5 print char 77
    for 6 print char 101
    for 7 print char 111
    for 8 print char 119

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `for` requires a number to be passed to it. Be it a pointer, memory or arbitrary number. But make sure you don’t pass a negative number. And don't leave it empty either. 🤔
If you did, it throws an error and stops the execution.
