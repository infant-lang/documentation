# What's Infant Lang?

Let's discover **Infant Lang in less than 5 minutes**.

## How did we get here?

- Inspired by BrainFuck 🧠 but does things in a less esoteric way.
- More elegant keywords for infants 👶
- Manual simplified control over the pointer 👆
- Conditional implementation with the simple ‘`f` ❓
- Memory 📦 for storing temporary data and manipulating it
- Easiest one line `for` loop 🏃‍♀️ for repetitive tasks such as multiplication

## What can it achieve?

We ❤ developers but love infants 👶 more. Infant lang is developed to promote infants to start coding 👩‍💻 with the stuff they can visualize 🦕 like moving their toy 🧸 along a line and storing their toys in a box 📦 

With the upcoming support for threads 🖇, Infant Lang helps infants understand how multitasking 🤹‍♀️ works inside computers and create wonderful things 🧱
